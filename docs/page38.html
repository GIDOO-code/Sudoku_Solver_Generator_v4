		<h2>Kraken (Finned)Fish</h2>
		<p>
		Kraken (Finned) Fish is an algorithm that combines Super Link with Fish.
		In the explanation here, i use simple Fish, but also with Franken/Mutant Fish.
		Furthermore, it also holds with generalized BaseSet/CoverSet.</p>
		<p>
		In Fish(left figure), if circled X is true, one of CoverSet's House is false, so Fish breaks.
		Also, in Finned Fish(right figure), if circled X is true, Fish breaks because one House is false.<br>
		</p>

		<p>In another expression, there is a weak link relationship 
		between the circled X and the CoverSet X that constitutes the Fish.<br></p>

		<p>Kraken (Finned) Fish is an analysis algorithm that extends the effectiveness of link to multiple links connections.
         For links, super links (inter-cell links, cell group links, ALS links) are used.<br><br>
		</p>

		<br><br><br>
		<p>
		Here is an example of Kraken (Finned) Fish.
		Kraken Fish is established for each of the inverted cells of the cell.
		However, there may be contradiction if the configuration cells of CoverSet or Fin cells becomes false.
		This depends on the false cell/digit as the starting point.
